Meme Generator:

This application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create memes from user input. Upon launching, the program prompts users to enter the URL for a given image, along with the text they would like to add on the top and bottom of the image. After clicking a 'create MEME' button, a meme is created by overlaying the user-provided text in block letters on top of the user-provided image.
